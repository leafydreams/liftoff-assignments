## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will be a visual calendar application to help users plan their day, week, or month. Event hosts will be able to create, edit, and delete/cancel events and invite attendees to add the event onto their schedules. Users will also be able to create daily to-do lists and keep track of tasks they have accomplished. The calendar can be personalized with use of some public APIs to add daily random facts or photos that enhance user experience by brightening their day.

We decided to make this because we wanted a personalized experience using a calendar with the added fun of dog photos, etc. This application will be a straightforward calendar application that is streamlined for easy use in collaboration.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to log in by creating an account within the application. This will allow for personalization of calendars (saving events to their calendar, creating new events, tracking progress on to-do lists).
Create and edit events: Users will be able to create events (add description, time, location), edit event entries, invite attendees, and delete/cancel events.
User notification: Users will receive email notification when they are invited to events, reminded that events are occurring, or when scheduled events on their calendar are cancelled.
To-Do list: Users will have the ability to make a checkbox list of tasks on any calendar day, which can be marked off as they are completed.
Personalization: Users will have the choice to receive random facts or photos upon daily visits to the calendar.
